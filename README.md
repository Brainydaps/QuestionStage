QuestionStage is a Python console application i wrote that utilizes natural language processing (NLP) techniques to analyze and respond to user input questions. Its key features include question analysis, knowledge retrieval, text processing, part-of-speech tagging, named entity recognition, contextual understanding, response generation, error handling, continuous learning, and integration with other applications. This script can be used as a building block for chatbots, virtual assistants, or other NLP systems to provide a more comprehensive language understanding and response generationÂ capability." Here are the key features:

1. Question Analysis: The script analyzes the input question to identify the keywords, parts of speech, and intent behind the question using a combination of libraries, models and tools like nltk, spacy, textblob.

2. Knowledge Retrieval: It retrieves relevant information from a predefined knowledge base (the responses dictionary) to answer the question.

3. Text Processing: The script performs text processing techniques like tokenization, stemming, and lemmatization to normalize the input question and knowledge base.

4. Part-of-Speech (POS) Tagging: It identifies the parts of speech (nouns, verbs, adjectives, etc.) in the input question to better understand its meaning.

5. Named Entity Recognition (NER): The script recognizes named entities (people, places, organizations, etc.) in the input question to provide more accurate answers.

6. Contextual Understanding: It uses contextual information to disambiguate words and phrases with multiple meanings.

7. Response Generation: Based on the analysis and knowledge retrieval, the script generates a response to the input question.

8. Error Handling: It includes error handling mechanisms to handle unknown questions, ambiguous questions, or questions with no clear answer.

9. Continuous Learning: The script can be trained with a lot more new questions and answers to improve its knowledge base and response accuracy over time.

10. Integration: It can be integrated with various applications, such as chatbots, virtual assistants, or other NLP systems, to provide a more comprehensive language understanding and response generation capability.

11. I tried so hard to integrate this python console application with .NET MAUI template, but it didnt work due to compatibility issues. I tried using python.NET and ironPython open source implementations of python that were built to integrate with .NET Framework, the application soure code compiled and launch succefully on both windows 11 and android 14 but it kept throughing an error: " the delegate for type initilializer threw an exception" within the loaded app itself, so i gave up trying after many days of debugging and brain storming. I will commit the project to git later for anyone who think they can solve it. Enjoy
