## Overview

*QuestionStage* is a Python console application that utilizes natural language processing (NLP) techniques to analyze and respond to user input questions. This script can be used as a building block for chatbots, virtual assistants, or other NLP systems to provide a comprehensive language understanding and response generation capability.

## Key Features

1. *Question Analysis*: Analyzes the input question to identify keywords, parts of speech, and intent using libraries like NLTK, spaCy, and TextBlob.

2. *Knowledge Retrieval*: Retrieves relevant information from a predefined knowledge base (the responses dictionary) to answer the question.

3. *Text Processing*: Performs text processing techniques such as tokenization, stemming, and lemmatization to normalize the input question and knowledge base.

4. *Part-of-Speech (POS) Tagging*: Identifies the parts of speech (nouns, verbs, adjectives, etc.) in the input question to better understand its meaning.

5. *Named Entity Recognition (NER)*: Recognizes named entities (people, places, organizations, etc.) in the input question to provide more accurate answers.

6. *Contextual Understanding*: Uses contextual information to disambiguate words and phrases with multiple meanings.

7. *Response Generation*: Generates a response to the input question based on the analysis and knowledge retrieval.

8. *Error Handling*: Includes mechanisms to handle unknown questions, ambiguous questions, or questions with no clear answer.

9. *Continuous Learning*: Can be trained with new questions and answers to improve its knowledge base and response accuracy over time.

10. *Integration*: Can be integrated with various applications, such as chatbots, virtual assistants, or other NLP systems, to provide comprehensive language understanding and response generation.

## Development Notes

I attempted to integrate this Python console application with a .NET MAUI template, but encountered compatibility issues. I tried using Python.NET and IronPython, which are open-source implementations of Python designed to integrate with the .NET Framework. The application source code compiled and launched successfully on both Windows 11 and Android 14, but it kept throwing an error: "the delegate for type initializer threw an exception" within the loaded app itself. After many days of debugging and brainstorming, I decided to discontinue this integration effort.

I will commit the project to GitHub later for anyone who thinks they can solve this issue. Enjoy!
